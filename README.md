## HOKUSAI [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/artsy/hokusai/tree/main.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/artsy/hokusai/tree/main)

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokusai"><img height="300" src="hokusai.jpg"></a>

Hokusai is a Docker + Kubernetes CLI for application developers.

Hokusai "dockerizes" applications and manages their lifecycle throughout development, testing, and release cycles.

Hokusai wraps calls to [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) with a CLI, and defines a CI workflow.

Hokusai currently only supports Kubernetes deployments on AWS, configured to pull from ECS container repositories (ECR), although other providers may be added in the future.

### Why Hokusai?

At [Artsy](http://www.artsy.net), as we began working with Kubernetes, while impressed with its design, capabilities, and flexibility, we were in need of tooling we could deliver to agile development teams that addressed the day-to-day tasks of application development, delivery, introspection and maintenance, while providing a clean and uncomplicated interface.

Transitioning teams to the Docker / Kubernetes ecosystem can be intimidating, and comes with a steep learning curve. We set out to create a Heroku-like CLI that would shepherd the application developer into the ecosystems of Docker and Kubernetes, and while introducing new tooling and concepts, outlining a clear practice for dependency management, local development, testing and CI, image repository structure, deployment and orchestration.

## Installation

### MacOS

We recommend installing via Homebrew:

```
$ brew update
$ brew tap artsy/formulas
$ brew install hokusai
```

If you previously installed Hokusai via an alternate installation method, you may need to force the `link` step.

```
$ brew link --overwrite hokusai
```

If you previously installed Hokusai via Pip, you may want to first uninstall it:

```
$ pip uninstall hokusai
```

### Linux

```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artsy/hokusai/main/get-hokusai.sh | sudo bash
```

Note: This method installs Hokusai to `/usr/local/bin/hokusai`.

### Pip

Hokusai can be installed via Pip, on MacOS or Linux. If you do so, please first go through [Pyenv](#Pyenv), [Python](#Python), and [Virtualenv](#Virtualenv) steps.

Python 3.7+ is required.

```
pip install hokusai
```

Note: If Pip fails at upgrading your system Python packages, try:

```
pip install hokusai --ignore-installed
```

### Docker

We also maintain [Hokusai Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/artsy/hokusai) for running Hokusai in Docker.

### Github

Release artifacts are available on [Github](https://github.com/artsy/hokusai/releases).

### AWS S3

Release artifacts are also available in AWS S3. You can use this [convenience script](get-hokusai.sh) or Curl to fetch them.

### A note on Python 2.x

Hokusai currently supports Python 3.7+ only. The last version that supported Python 2.x was [v0.5.18](https://github.com/artsy/hokusai/tree/v0.5.18).

## Setup

We assume that your org admin has already set up a Kubernetes cluster and an AWS infrastructure, and that your local environment has Git, Docker, and Docker-Compose installed. Perform the following steps to get Hokusai working:

1. Ensure your org admin has completed the steps mentioned in [Administering Hokusai](./docs/Administering_Hokusai.md).

2. Configure your local environment with [AWS credentials](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html#configuring-credentials).

3. Run [hokusai configure command](docs/Command_Reference.md#configuring-hokusai-for-your-organization).

4. Optionally, enable Bash autocompletion:

    ```
    eval "$(_HOKUSAI_COMPLETE=source hokusai)"
    ```

## Getting Started

Once Hokusai is configured, you can start using it on a project. Please see [Getting Started](./docs/Getting_Started.md).

## Command Reference

A full command reference can be found in [Command Reference](./docs/Command_Reference.md).

## Review Apps

Hokusai can be used to simplify the process of spinning up a "review app" instance of your project, based on a feature branch or pull request.

Full details are in the [Review App reference](./docs/Review_Apps.md).

## Hokusai Files

A descripton of all the [files used by Hokusai](docs/hokusai_files.md).

## Developing Hokusai

To work on Hokusai itself, please set up:

### Pyenv

We recommend using [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install the correct version of Python. For a tutorial of Pyenv, see [this guide](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/).

When installing on MacOS, please make sure to use brew-installed `openssl` and `readline` libraries, and xcode-installed `zlib` library. And make sure these libraries are correctly linked. Like so:

```
brew install openssl readline zlib

echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/include"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib/pkgconfig"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

### Python

Hokusai is currently tested on Python 3.9.10 so we recommend using that Python version.

If you use Pyenv to install Python, you should see an output similar to this:

```
pyenv install 3.9.10

    python-build: use openssl from homebrew
    python-build: use readline from homebrew

    Downloading Python-3.9.10.tar.xz...
    -> https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.10/Python-3.9.10.tar.xz
    Installing Python-3.9.10...
    python-build: use tcl-tk from homebrew
    python-build: use readline from homebrew
    python-build: use zlib from xcode sdk

    Installed Python-3.9.10 to $HOME/.pyenv/versions/3.9.10
```

With the desired Python version installed, activate it globally:

```
pyenv global 3.9.10
```

Note: If you want to create a PyInstaller distribution, Python must be installed with development libraries. Use the environment variable `PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-framework"` on Darwin and `PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-shared"` on Linux when running `pyenv install`.

### Virtualenv

We recommend using a virtual environment to isolate Hokusai's dependencies from that of other projects on your local environment.

The Pyenv install comes with [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) which can be used to create virtual environments.

### Poetry

Use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to install Hokusai's dependencies as well as Hokusai itself in [editable mode](https://pip-python3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install.html#editable-installs). Please see [this guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/) for working with Poetry.

Install Poetry:

```
pip install poetry
```

Install dependencies and Hokusai in editable mode:

```
poetry install
```

To update dependencies:

```
poetry lock
```

### Local Dev Hokusai Version

The version reported by `hokusai version` is taken from `hokusai/_version.py` file. The file is dynamically generated by [setuptools_scm](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm) during CI and it is not version controlled. To have the file in local dev, run:

```
python -m setuptools_scm
```

## Testing

### Install Minikube

[Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) is used for integration tests.

```
brew install minikube
minikube start --kubernetes-version=<version of your Kubernetes clusters, example: v1.2.3>
```

### Run tests

To run unit and smoke tests:

```
make test
```

To run integration tests:

```
make integration
```

Only specific modules, TestClasses, or even methods:

```
python -m unittest test.unit.test_module.TestClass.test_method
```

Tip: Set `DEBUG=1` environment variable to print boto logging


## Distributing Hokusai

### Beta Release

Merging a branch into `main` automatically creates a beta version useful for testing.

To install the beta:

#### MacOS

```
$ brew uninstall hokusai
$ brew uninstall hokusai-beta
$ brew update
$ brew tap artsy/formulas
$ brew install hokusai-beta
```

#### Linux

```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artsy/hokusai/main/get-hokusai.sh | sudo bash -s beta
```

### Official Release

To create an official release, such as `v1.2.3`, perform the following:

- Create a branch named `prepare-v1.2.3` and make the following changes:
  - Bump version in [RELEASE_VERSION](./RELEASE_VERSION) file.
  - Upate [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).
  - Open a PR to merge into `main`. Please see [past PRs](https://github.com/artsy/hokusai/pulls?q=is%3Apr+Release+is%3Aclosed+%22prepare+version%22) for example.

- [Open a PR](https://github.com/artsy/hokusai/compare/release...main?expand=1) to merge `main` into `release`. Please see [past PRs](https://github.com/artsy/hokusai/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+%22release+version%22) for example.
