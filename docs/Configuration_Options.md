# Configuration Options

## Global configuration

Hokusai requires IAM configuration for working with AWS resources. It uses the Boto3 library and [loads configuration](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html#configuring-credentials) from a local file or via the environment variables `$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

You can set defaults for certain command options in `./hokusai/config.yml` or in environment variables.  See below for project-specific configuration variables and their environment-variable fallbacks.  The order of precedence for these variables is as follows:

- If the configuration variable is bound to a command-line option, the option supplied on the command line always takes precedence.
- If the configuration variable is provided in `./hokusai/config.yml` it is used as the option if not supplied on the command line.
- If an environment variable is set it is used as a fallback.
- The default value from the command-line option is used.

When running `hokusai configure` the following files are created:

* `kubectl` installed on your $PATH
* Your organization-specific `~/.kube/config` kubectl configuration file

## Project configuration

When running `hokusai setup` the following files are created:

* `./hokusai/config.yml` contains project-specific configuration variables.  It is loaded a top-level hash that accepts the following keys:

    - `project-name`: <string> (required) - The project name
    - `hokusai-required-version`: <string> (optional) - A [PEP-440 version specifier string](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#version-specifiers).  Hokusai will raise an error when running commands if its current version does not satisfy these version specifications.  For example: `~=0.5`, `==0.5.1`, `>=0.4.0,<0.4.6`, `!=0.1.*` are all valid version specifier strings
    - `template-config-files`: <list> (optional) - Load template config files from the desired URIs, either `s3://` or a local file path.  See [Kubernetes Yaml Template Processing](#kubernetes-yaml-template-processing) for further details.
    - `pre-build`: <string> (optional) - A pre-build hook - useful to inject dynamic environment variables into the build, for example: `export COMMIT_HASH=$(git rev-parse HEAD)`
    - `post-build`: <string> (optional) - A post-build hook - useful for image post-processing
    - `pre-deploy`: <string> (optional) - A pre-deploy hook - useful to enforce migrations
    - `post-deploy`: <string> (optional) - A post-deploy hook - useful for deploy notifications
    - `git-remote`: <string> (optional) - Push deployment tags to git remote when invoking the `hokusai [staging|production] deploy` or the `hokusai pipeline promote` commands.  Can either be a local alias like 'origin' or a URI like `git@github.com:artsy/hokusai.git`.  Bound to the `--git-remote` option for these commands.
    - `run-tty`: <boolean> (optional) - Attach the terminal to your shell session when invoking `hokusai [staging|production|review_app] run`.  Bound to the `--tty` option for this command, and falls back to by the `HOKUSAI_RUN_TTY` env var.
    - `follow-logs`: <boolean> (optional) - Follow log output when invoking `hokusai [staging|production|review_app] logs`.  Bound to the `--follow` option for this command, and falls back to the `HOKUSAI_FOLLOW_LOGS` env var.
    - `tail-logs`: <integer> (optional) - Tail N lines of log output when invoking `hokusai [staging|production|review_app] logs`.  Bound to the `--tail` option for this command, and falls back to the `HOKUSAI_TAIL_LOGS` env var.
    - `run-constraints`: <list of kubernetes label selector strings> - Constrain run containers to Kubernetes nodes matching the label selectors in the form `key=value` by setting the `nodeSelector` field on the container's spec. Bound to the `--constrint` option for `hokusai [staging|production|review_app] run` as well as containers run via the `--migration` flag as well as `pre-deploy` / `post-deploy` hooks triggered by `hokusai [staging|production|review_app] deploy` or `hokusai pipeline promote`.  Falls back to the `HOKUSAI_RUN_CONSTRAINTS` env var, in which case a list is parsed from a comma-delimited string.
    - `always-verbose`: <boolean> (optional) - Always pront verbose output.  Bound to the `--verbose` option for various commands, and falls back to the `HOKUSAI_ALWAYS_VERBOSE` env var.

* `./hokusai/build.yml` is the base docker-compose Yaml file referenced when running `hokusai local` commands. It should contain a single service for the project, `build` referencing the root project directory, and any build args (i.e.) host environment variables to inject into the Dockerfile.

* `./hokusai/development.yml` is the docker-compose Yaml file referenced when running `hokusai local dev` commands. It should contain a definition for your project service (extending `./hokusai/build.yml`) as well as development environment variables and any dependent services.

* `./hokusai/test.yml` is the docker-compose Yaml file referenced when running `hokusai local test`. It should contain a definition for your project service (extending `./hokusai/build.yml`) as well as test environment variables and any dependent services.

* `./hokusai/staging.yml` is the Kubernetes Yaml file referenced with running `hokusai staging` subcommands. It should contain a `Deployment` and a `Service` definition for the project as well as any dependent deployments and/or services.

* `./hokusai/production.yml` is the Kubernetes Yaml file referenced with running `hokusai production` subcommands. It should contain a `Deployment` and a `Service` definition for the project as well as any dependent deployments and/or services.

These files are meant to be modified on a per-project basis.  You can (and should) use them as a starting point and modify them to suit the needs of your application.  Hokusai remains agnostic about the content of these files, only passes them to `docker-compose` and `kubectl` as part of its workflow.  To see how exactly these files are being used by Hokusai, run commands with the `-v / --verbose` flag.

### Kubernetes Yaml Template Processing

In order to support flexible configuration across multiple projects and keep Kubernetes Yaml specs DRY, Hokusai treats `./hokusai/staging.yml`, `./hokusai/production.yml` as well as other Yaml files overridden as `--filename` or referenced by a review app as [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/) templates which are rendered before passing the files to the Kubernetes API server.

The default [template context dictionary](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#variables) includes the variables `project_name` and `project_repo` and the context can be extended by providing the location of multiple Yaml files to the `template-config-files` project config parameter.  These files must contain a dictionary as a single document.  The dictionaries are merged into the template context dictionary in the order specified.  Any variables defined in the template and not included in the context dictionary will result in Hokusai raising an error, as will invalid operations on a variable, i.e. attempting to access a missing property of a variable of the wrong type.

For advanced template design see Jinja's [template designer documentation](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/).

#### Tips on template design
  - If you get errors when sending Kubernetes Yaml to the Kubernetes API server, set the `DEBUG` environment variable to print out the rendered Yaml.
  - Pay attention to whitespace and indentation in rendered Yaml files.  Use the [whitespace control](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#whitespace-control) features to strip leading and trailing whitespace and the [indent filter](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#indent) to control indentation.
  - Make use of [template inheritance](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#template-inheritance) to share config snippets between Yaml templates.  You can extend or include any other template file in the `./hokusai` directory.

### Environment Injection

In order to inject an application's environment into running containers, Hokusai templates each `Deployment` in `./hokusai/staging.yml` and `./hokusai/production.yml` with the following definition:

```
spec:
  spec:
    containers:
      envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
          name: {{ project_name }}-environment
```

This instructs Kubernetes to use the `ConfigMap` object named `{project-name}-environment` as a key-value mapping of environment variables to set in the container runtime environment.  `hokusai [staging|production] env` commands are designed to manage this environment.

Note: When changing the project environment (i.e. after running `hokusai [staging|production] env set FOO=bar`) you need to run `hokusai [staging|production] deployment refresh` to re-create the project deployment's containers as Kubernetes will not propogate the new environment variables automatically.

### Kubernetes labels and selectors

Hokusai prescribes a deployment strategy and label structure for the `Deployment` and `Service` definitions it creates in `./hokusai/staging.yml` and `./hokusai/production.yml`.

It templates a `Deployment` with the following structure:

```
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: {{ project_name }}
        layer: web
        component: application
```

And a `Service` with the following structure:

```
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: {{ project_name }}
    layer: application
    component: web
  type: ClusterIP
```

Custom templates as well as additional Deployments and Services should preserve the label structure `app` / `layer` / `component` label structure.  Hokusai will only target deployments with the `app={project_name},layer=application` label selector when running `hokusai [staging|production]` subcommands.

For example, to add a worker `Deployment` to `./hokusai/staging.yml` or `./hokusai/production.yml` you would create it with the following labels:

```
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: {{ project_name }}
        layer: application
        component: worker
```

With this structure, Hokusai will update *both* the web and worker deployments simultaneuosly, which is probably what you want.

If you do not want this, and for example want to include a Redis `Deployment` in `./hokusai/staging.yml` or `./hokusai/production.yml` you would create it with the following labels:

```
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: {{ project_name }}
        layer: cache
        component: redis
```

Hokusai would ignore this when `hokusai [staging|production]` commands, but it would be included as part of your application's Kubernetes environment.
